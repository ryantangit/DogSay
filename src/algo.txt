create a new list that will be used to output lines
for each word, 
	track if the len(word) + curr_line exceeds max length, if so push to next
	edgecase of word being greater than maxlength, and just truncate that word for now

for each line,
	add padding for uniform
	<> for single lines
	/ \, | |, \ / for multilines
